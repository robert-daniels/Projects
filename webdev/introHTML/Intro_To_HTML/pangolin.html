    <h1>Pangolin</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (from Ancient Greek φολῐ́ς,
        "horny scale"). The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis comprises
        the four species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in Sub-Saharan
        Africa. These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are
        also known.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with this
        feature. They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet
        consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long tongues. They tend to be solitary
        animals, meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two
        years.</p>
