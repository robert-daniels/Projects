Used the axios library to make an API call, which is one step easier than the fetch mechanism. 

On the HTML

did not use npm for axios, used the cdn 

form review: form is used to not overload the api with calls every character typed. the form id is 'searchForm'. 
it has one text value wiht a placeholder, and the value name is 'userSearch'

On the app.js

DOM review to assign various elements to a variable 

added an eventListener to the form to prevent the default behavior (reloading the page on submit, in this case)
the eventListener function is an async, pulls the value from the form. 
defines the apiConfig items per api documentation. (passing params as key value pairs)

used axios.get(url, config)

looped through the response (returned as an array) and for each array element that had an image, appended that image to the results div.
