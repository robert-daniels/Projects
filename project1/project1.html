      <h1>Project 1: Question and Answers</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the purpose of JavaScript?  Answer in general and also provide three specific examples of how JavaScript is commonly used.
            <p>JavaScript is meant to make webpages "alive" per the book. It adds dimensions to bring the site from a basic rendering of a text file to a functioning computing interface. Also per the book, below are some of the explicit functionalities of JS: </p></li> 
              <ul>
                <li>JS can add new HTML to a page, as well as modify styles</li>
                <li>It can react to user actions such as clicking</li>
                <li>JS can sent requests over the network to remote servers</li>
              </ul>
            &nbsp;

          <li> Who invented JavaScript and when?
            <p>Per w3schools, JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995</p></li>
    
          <li>What software program will you be using to write JavaScript?
            <p>JavaScript is written in a text editor. This can be an IDE like goorm or VS Code, or as simple as Notepad++</p></li>
    

          <li>What software program will you be using to run JavaScript?
            <p>Anything that has a functional javascript engine, though for us the standard browsers (chrome, firefox, etc.) should work.</p></li>


          <li>Why are external scripts preferable to scripts added directly within an HTML file?
            <p>clean coding, less cluttered file, easier to maintain/update, script downloads to cache and only needs downloaded once for the site (reduces traffic)</p></li>
      
      </ol>
        <p>-- What's the point of all of those console.log() statements?</p>

        <h3><b>What, you mean these?</b></h3>

        <img class="screengrab" src="images/Console.log" alt="screen capture of the console">
        <p>console.log makes visible the data stored in memory. otherwise, it would be difficult to know if our scripts are actually working correctly.</p>
      
      -- What's the difference between how you reference a variable versus a string in a JavaScript statement?
      <p>Not sure I get what this question is going for. but use case could be the below:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>referencing a string: console.log("hello world");</li>
            <li>let greeting = "hello world"; console.log(`${greeting}`)</li>
            <li>Essentially, a string is just a string. A variable (not constant) can be updated/changed/altered to suit needs. It can also be re-used in various other parts of the code.</li>
          </ul>
      -- What's the difference between a single value and an expression in a JavaScript statement?
          <p>A single value is stored in a location, or has a single pointer to it. An expression must pull x values from memory into the buffer, perform the computation, and then possibly store that result in a different memory location.</p>

     <script>
     "use strict" // 3.

     alert("Hi World!"); // 1.
    
     let name = "Robert";  // 2. 
     console.log(`Hi ${name}`);

     <script> // 4. start
       "use strict"  // 3.

       const myName = "Robert";
       let mySalary = 150000;
       let vetStatus = false; // 6. 

       console.log(`Hello! My name is ${myName} and my salary is ${mySalary}.`);

       mySalary = 200000; // 5. 

       console.log(`My name is ${myName} and my new salary is ${mySalary}.`);

       // 7. start

       console.log(`The data type of myName is ${typeof myName}.`);
       console.log(`The data type of mySalary is ${typeof mySalary}.`);
       console.log(`The data type of vetStatus is ${typeof vetStatus}.`);
      
       // 8. 

       // load a list with the statements, and assign it to the variable "listing"
       let listing = [("" + 1 + 0), ("" - 1 + 0), (true + false),  
                  (6 / "3"), ("2" * "3"), (4 + 5 + "px"),
                  ("$" + 4 + 5 ), ("4" - 2 ), ("4px" - 2 ),
                  (7 / 0 ), ("  -9  " + 5 ), ("  -9  " - 5 ),
                  (null + 1 ), (undefined + 1)]; 
      
       // since a list is iterable, use the iterable logic "for each iterant in listing, do this"           
       for ( let i in listing){
         console.log(`${listing[i]}`);
       }

      // 9. 

      let x = 5;
      let y = 1 + (x *= 2);

      console.log(`The value of x for question 9 is ${x}.`);
      console.log(`The value of y for question 9 is ${y}.`);


      // x calculated: x is assigned to 5. then mid-call for y, x is assigned x = x * 2. 5 * 2 = 10
      // y calculated: y is assigned to 1 + the ending value of x after it is updated. Thus 1 + (10) = 11
