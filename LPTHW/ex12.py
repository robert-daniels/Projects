#learning how to prompt, can put strings inside the input() fx directly

#have user assign values to variables

age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you in cm? ")
weight = input("how much do you weight in lbs? ")

#output

print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall in cm, and {weight} heavy in lbs.")
