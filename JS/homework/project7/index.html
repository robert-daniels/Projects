        <ol>
            <li>Identify a common JavaScript style guide, and hyperlink to it.
                <p>A styleguide mentioned in the book is the Google JavaScript Style Guide. 
                   Click <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html">here</a> to proceed to their GitHub repository. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Identify three distinct "best practice" programming practices and explain how they create better code.
                <p>Keep the horizontal line length of code under a specified character count (determined by style guide.)</p>
                <p>Avoid over-complicated nesting of conditionals when there are better alternatives. </p>
                <p>Comments should be used for abstract high level uses of functions. They should not repeat what the function is doing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Identify three distinct sloppy programming practices and explain the problems they each create.
                <p>Sacrificing readability and explcit communication in favor of a shorter line of code. This code may be harder for others to understand and maintain, as well as yourself. Explicit and standard is usually better than clever and novel.</p>
                <p>Using ambiguous / vague variable names. A person should be able to tell what a variable is at a glance. If they can't, resources have to be invested to track down something that the reviewer cannot even Control-F for.</p>
                <p>Functions not being built for a single purpose. A function that is named something like isReady() should evaluate and return a boolean. It should not alter the underlying values. This makes the code confusing, harder to maintain, and more difficult to determine when best to use a tool.</p>
