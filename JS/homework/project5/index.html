        <p id="greeting">Hello!</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?
                <p>Besides the difference in syntax, a key difference between these two is --when-- these functions "go live." A function declaration in the main code flow has a global scope. It is accessible throughout the script, as the engine is keyed to scan the script as a whole looking for it. A function expression is not allocated, and thus not accessible, until the engine reaches and "defines" the expression to the variable name.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>Why do we create functions in the first place?
                <p>I like to think of functions as tools. They are a helpful way to abstract what a program is doing. If a block of code is being used several times in a script, then condensing this down into a function both increases readability and cuts down on repetitive code. The end result is code that is easier to maintain and update. A suitable metaphor might be a power drill: I don't want to re-build a power drill each time I need it. As well, a power drill can take different attachments (parameters) that use the underlying machinery in ways that suit the job.</p>
